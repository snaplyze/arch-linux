# Validation and evidence

Validation is layered and tree-bound. No old report or status document is evidence for the current
source candidate.

## Source evidence

Contains exact source identity and the commands/statuses for syntax, version, bootstrap, static,
function, Marble, package metadata, documentation, portability, secret, agent, maintenance,
repository fixture and ShellCheck tests. It must not include generated package or VM outputs.

## Build evidence

Contains the clean Arch environment identity, canonical unsigned package closure,
`UNSIGNED-SHA256SUMS`, package metadata and verifier result. Monthly A+B comparison is advisory and
is recorded separately from the required canonical release build.

## QEMU evidence

Contains the accepted ISO identity, QEMU/OVMF versions, new qcow2 and independent VARS identities,
scenario configuration, installer/repository identities and a structured result. The exact release
matrix is Minimal TTY/ext4/systemd-boot, Stock GNOME/Btrfs/LUKS2/GRUB and
Marble/Btrfs/LUKS2/systemd-boot with the separate experimental Marble GDM opt-in. All three staged
runs bind the same independently verified production-signed repository archive, source commit/tree,
build-metadata hash, unsigned-manifest hash and frozen Arch ISO hash.
The staged inputs are the exact 14 Phase-A assets, whose signed checksum manifest covers exactly 12
non-self files. Finalization is allowed only after all three functional PASS results and preserves all
14 bytes while adding signed acceptance JSON and evidence archive for exact 18.

Each scenario retains a short compressed installer log, input and tool hashes, the signed repository
manifest/signature and package/database hashes, functional assertions and a structured PASS or FAIL.
A FAIL includes the failed phase and non-zero exit status. Check actual GDM password login and the
resulting Wayland session, lock/unlock, update and repeated login. Screenshots help diagnose the
result but are optional; no sampling interval or human receipt is required.

After each scenario remove its qcow2, OVMF VARS, payload, extracted repository and TLS runtime,
check that its QEMU/server processes exited, and retain `qemu-img check`. Never retain passwords,
private keys, passphrases or recovery material. Keep reports compact and separate from source;
the release evidence archive has a 500 MiB storage cap, not a frame timing or visual certification
requirement. Do not scan VM disks as if they were text logs.

## Release evidence

Contains signed repository/release-asset verification, immutable release asset identities, Pages
readback and the final public VM result. It is created only after the corresponding operations and
cannot retroactively change source/build/QEMU results.
The acceptance JSON binds the commit/tree/canonical source SHA-256, build/unsigned/snapshot hashes,
the exact Phase-A name/hash/size map and aggregate, its manifest hash, three PASS verdicts,
evidence no larger than 500 MiB and `deferred=[]`.

The final public Marble/GDM VM carries no local product bytes: it downloads the immutable tagged bootstrap, verifies the Release installer and
public key, executes only that verified installer, and obtains project packages and databases from
the exact public Pages URL under `PackageRequired DatabaseRequired TrustedOnly`. Public readback
verifies signed `RELEASE-SHA256SUMS`, the exact archive digest and signature, byte equality between
the archive and Pages manifests/signatures, schema-2 source/build identity, all 23 Pages object
hashes/sizes, and all package/canonical-database signatures. Merely echoing an expected archive hash
or validating an unbound Pages manifest is not public readback evidence.

## Status discipline

Use exactly one status per check: `EXECUTED_PASS`, `EXECUTED_FAIL`, `REVIEWED_ONLY`,
`NOT_RUN_ENVIRONMENT` or `NOT_APPLICABLE`. Record exact commands for executed tests. Absence of a
required environment is not a PASS.
